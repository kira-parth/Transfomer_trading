ðŸ“ˆ Forex Price Prediction using a Transformer Model
This project is a deep learning implementation for forecasting foreign exchange (Forex) market prices. It utilizes a Transformer-based neural network, a state-of-the-art architecture for sequence-based tasks, to predict future closing prices based on historical data and technical indicators.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate a sophisticated deep learning model for time-series forecasting. The script is a complete end-to-end pipeline that performs the following steps:

Data Loading: Ingests historical Forex data from a CSV file.

Feature Engineering: Enriches the dataset by calculating several common technical analysis indicators like RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Average Slope.

Data Preprocessing: Scales the features to a uniform range using MinMaxScaler to prepare them for the neural network.

Model Training: Trains a Transformer Encoder model using PyTorch to learn patterns from sequences of historical data.

Evaluation & Visualization: Assesses the model's performance on a test set using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and plots the predicted prices against the actual prices.

## Technology Stack
PyTorch: The core deep learning framework used to build and train the Transformer model.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and loading the CSV dataset.

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing, specifically feature scaling.

ta: A technical analysis library used for automated feature engineering.

Matplotlib: For plotting the final results and visualizing the model's predictions.
